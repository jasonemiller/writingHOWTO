writingHOWTO
============

HOWTO for collaboratively writing with git and flat text files (*e.g.*, latex, multimarkdown).

This is a project to develop a document that will assist colleagues to use git in collaborative writing with me and others who use github as a shared repository.  Co-authors will use either LaTeX (for technical documents or grant proposals) or Multimarkdown (for narrative documents and non-technical white papers).

This documentation assumes collaborators are working with me (Jason Miller) and with the shared repository at github.com/TrumanSTEP.
